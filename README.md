# Slack Channel Chameleon
"Chameleon" comes from the idea that the bot always adapts based on the messages sent to the channel. It's not a great name, but I couldn't think of anything better.  
  
This is a Slack bot that hosts a game around restricting what messages you can send in a particular channel.  
The game rules are still a work in progress; the project is mostly so I can learn how to write a Slack bot.
