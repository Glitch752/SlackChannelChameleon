# Slack Channel Chameleon
I'm not sure what I'm doing with this project yet, but here's the concept:

This is a Slack bot that hosts a game around restricting what messages you can send in a particular channel.  
The game rules are still a work in progress; I'm mostly making it so I can learn how bolt works. I want to find an interesting twist to create an incentive to send messages, but this is mostly a proof of concept for now.  

"Chameleon" comes from the idea that the bot always adapts based on the messages sent to the channel. It's not a very good name, but I couldn't think of anything better.
