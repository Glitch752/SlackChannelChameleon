I want to find an interesting twist to create an incentive to send messages, but this is mostly a proof of concept for now.  \r\n\r\n\"Chameleon\" comes from the idea that the bot always adapts based on the messages sent to the channel. It's not a very good name, but I couldn't think of anything better."
